## Attribution
Plugin is from https://github.com/walm/jshint.vim

## What this provides
- 2 or 4 spaces instead of tabs (2 is default; Ctrl-f sets it to four and Ctrl-t back to 2)
- Auto-indentation can be toggled on and off with Ctrl-i
- Line numbers that can be toggled on and off with Ctrl-n
- jshint on save

I find the toggling useful when copying and pasting using the mouse (numbers off to copy, smartindent off to paste).

## How to install (globally for all users)

Copy the entire contents of the repo into `/etc/vim`.
